But that doesn't make it wasteful. Before deciding yourself whether it is worth this energy, please put some energy in learning what "proof-of-work" actually is, and what you get in return.

There is a lot of misinformation about Bitcoin stated as "facts" or "research". Because Bitcoin is also complex, it is not surpising people stop educating themselves after hearing again and again it is supposedly boiling the oceans and facilitating criminals.

After 10+ years knowing about Bitcoin but ignoring it because of that exact reasons, I recently learned I was very wrong.
My aim is to provide you with information so you can learn about what Bitcoin and proof-of-work really is.
